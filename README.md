# Curriculum-It

Curriculum-It is a task manager app specifically designed for self-learners. 

Here's how it works:

* The user creates a profile using a local sign up, or social media authentication. 
* The user adds subjects that they want to learn, which the app saves and displays on the main page. 
* From there, the user can click on any of the subjects in order to add them to a list of active “courses.” 
* Once the user is finished with a topic, they can set it as completed, or they can delete the course at any time.

## Future Development

In future versions, Curriculum-It will have a more robust learning plan organization system based on SMART goals and other best practices for self-directed learning. 

It will: 

* Prompt the user for input on variables like the type of subject they’re learning
* Break down goals into smaller parts
* Integrate learning sources the user wants to use for specific sub-topics
* Integrate projects and smaller activities
* Add specific deadlines and prompts
